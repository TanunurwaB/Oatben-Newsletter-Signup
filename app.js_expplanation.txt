This code is a Node.js application that uses the Express framework to create a web server.
 The server handles a form submission from a webpage, processes the data, and sends it to an external API (Mailchimp) for adding new subscribers. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Importing Required Modules

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const request = require("request");
const https = require('https');
const { METHODS } = require('http');
const { log } = require('console');
```
- **express**: A web application framework for Node.js used to create a web server.
- **bodyParser**: Middleware that parses incoming request bodies (usually from forms) and makes the data accessible via `req.body`.
- **request**: A module used for making HTTP requests (although it's not used in the final code).
- **https**: A module for making HTTPS requests.
- **METHODS** and **log**: These are destructured imports from the `http` and `console` modules, but they are not used in this code.

### 2. Initializing the Express Application

```javascript
const app = express();
```
- **app**: This initializes an Express application.

### 3. Serving Static Files

```javascript
app.use(express.static("public"));
```
- This line serves static files (like CSS, images, etc.) from the "public" directory.

### 4. Using Middleware to Parse Form Data

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```
- **bodyParser.urlencoded**: This middleware parses the URL-encoded data from forms, making it available in `req.body`.

### 5. Handling the GET Request to Serve the Signup Page

```javascript
app.get("/", function(req, res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/signup.html")
});
```
- **app.get("/")**: When a GET request is made to the root URL (`/`), this function is executed.
- **res.sendFile**: It sends the `signup.html` file to the client's browser. `__dirname` refers to the directory in which the current script resides.

### 6. Handling the POST Request to Submit the Form

```javascript
app.post("/", function(req, res){
    var name = req.body.FName;
    var lastname = req.body.LName;
    var Email = req.body.email;
```
- **app.post("/")**: When a POST request is made to the root URL (`/`), this function is executed.
- The form data is extracted from `req.body`, assuming that the form fields are named `FName`, `LName`, and `email`.

### 7. Creating a Data Object to Send to Mailchimp

```javascript
    var data = {
        members: [
            {
                email_address: Email,
                status: "subscribed",
                merge_fields: {
                    FNAME: name,
                    LNAME: lastname
                }
            }
        ]
    };
```
- **data**: This object is structured according to the Mailchimp API. It contains an array of `members`, where each member has an `email_address`, a `status` of "subscribed", and `merge_fields` for additional information (like first and last names).

### 8. Converting the Data Object to JSON

```javascript
    var stringedData = JSON.stringify(data);
```
- **stringedData**: The `data` object is converted into a JSON string, which is necessary for sending it to the Mailchimp API.

### 9. Defining the Mailchimp API URL and Options

```javascript
    const url = "https://us13.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/e076987432";
    const options = {
        method: "POST",
        auth: "Tanunurwa:a316aca817e9757bd20b4be1700a1333-us13"
    };
```
- **url**: The Mailchimp API URL for the specific list you're adding subscribers to (identified by the list ID `e076987432`).
- **options**: Configuration for the HTTP request, specifying the `method` as `POST` and the `auth` option with a username (`Tanunurwa`) and an API key (`a316aca817e9757bd20b4be1700a1333-us13`).

### 10. Sending the Data to Mailchimp

```javascript
    const request = https.request(url, options, function(response){
        response.on("data", function(data){
            console.log(JSON.parse(data));
        });
    });
```
- **https.request**: This function sends a POST request to the Mailchimp API.
- **response.on("data")**: This event listener handles the response from Mailchimp. It logs the response data (after parsing it from JSON).

### 11. Sending the Stringified Data

```javascript
    request.write(stringedData);
    request.end();
```
- **request.write(stringedData)**: This sends the `stringedData` (the JSON string) to Mailchimp.
- **request.end()**: This ends the request, signaling that all data has been sent.

### 12. Starting the Server

```javascript
app.listen(3000, function(){
    console.log("Server is running on port @Port: 3000");
});
```
- **app.listen(3000)**: This starts the server, listening on port 3000.
- **console.log**: Logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running.

### Summary
This code creates a simple web server using Express. It serves an HTML signup form, processes the submitted data, and sends it to the Mailchimp API to add a new subscriber to a mailing list. The server runs on port 3000.
